BhLiveCode for Gideros and ZeroBrane Studio
===========================================

This is the project folder for the Box 2d "Physics Clock" that appears in my video, [20 Minutes to Awesome](http://youtu.be/wPYvJxFxMkM). You might choose to follow along with the video, or just mess with the code. Everything is MIT licensed to feel free use how you please, although attribution would be appreciated.

This project also makes use of the new Gideros Easy initialization library pioneered by [Arturs Sosins](http://appcodingeasy.com). You can get this from [GitHub](https://github.com/ar2rsawseen/GiderosInit).

Folder Structure
----------------

This module is part of the general Bowerhaus library for Gideros mobile. There are a number of cooperating modules in this library, each with it's own Git repository. In order that the example project files will run correctly "out of the box" you should create an appropriate directory structure and clone/copy the files within it.
